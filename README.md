Ever wondered how the internet and telecommunication works?
Any idea what internet is?

Internet is the world's largest network.With many computers and servers inter-connected to each other.Internet is a structured, organized system.
So what is a network?
Network is a connection of devices connected to each other either through physical connection or logical connection.
what is a logical connection?.nothing but a wireless communication.
Talking of which how do you think the internet in connected?
yea, you thouhgt its wireless and through stalite right?
well,you are not completly wrong but still we use wired connection to connect between server(isp)of different countaries.And the isp also through the copper or fiber cable we get it to our modem at home after getting a subscrption from the isp.Through the modem we are getting the so called wifi(wireless) connection.

If someone goes to a countary without knowing that countary's language abviously they will use ENGILSH as the mode of communication.Similarly therre are various type and kinds of devices out there in the world,so how do they communicate eachother.Thats where a protocol comes to play.A protocol is a standard way of communication in networking.There are some international agencies who makes the standardised protocol so that all device will follow same standard of communication.
Some examples are:ITU,IEEE,IETF.....

In the mid 1960's computers where unable to communicate as a stand alone device .The The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the Department of
Defense (DOD) was interested in finding a way to connect computers together.Following which in 1967 ,at Association for Computing Machinery meeting ARPA presented the ARPANET small netwok of computers which communicated through specialized computer called IMP(interface message processor) this came to reality in 1969 which connected 4 nodes at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and the University of Utah for which NCP(Network Control Protocol) provided the host communication.

In 1973 Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn introduced new version for NCP which include features like as encapsulation, the datagram, and the func-
tions of a gateway.In October 1977, an internet consisting of three different networks was successfully demonstrated. Communication between networks was now possible.Shortly thereafter, authorities made a decision to split TCP into two protocols:
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) TCP would be responsible for higher level functions such as segmentation, reassembly, and error detection
Internet Protocol (IP). IP would handle datagram routing while . The new combination became known as TCP/IP.
